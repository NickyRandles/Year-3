				St Olivers Community Centre Ltd (SOCCL) operates a multi-purpose modern community centre in Ratoath, including a 234 seat theatre, a community creche, a restaurant and 5 large multi-purpose rooms together with a 7 acre community sports campus hosting tennis, rugby, athletics and other sports.
				</p>
				<p>
				SOCCL is a company limited by guarantee with charitable status and whose principal activity is the provision of community facilities for the Ratoath area on a not for profit basis. It is governed by a Board of Directors who are all unpaid volunteers.
				</p>
				<p>
				SOCCL succeeded the previous Ratoath Parish Hall Committee which had been formed in 1981 to erect a new community hall which in turn had replaced the previous committee who had overseen the original Parochial Hall which had served the Ratoath community since the 1930's
				</p>
				<p>
				SOCCL opened the current community centre in 2006 at which time the population of Ratoath was almost 7,000. By 2014 the population has grown to over 11,000 and as a community Ratoath has the highest proportion of young persons aged under 14 in the entire country.
				</p>
				<p>
				SOCCL employs a total of 19 people. Almost half are funded by State grants ( Pobal CSP, CE, TUS) and the remainder are self funded from SOCCL activities. To better co-ordinate its community activities and to best identify and meet future community needs, SOCCL have now formed a new Ratoath Community Board (RCB) made up of unpaid volunteers from a cross section of the Ratoath community covering interests such as arts, sport, disability, business, tidy towns, youth, urban development, communications.
				<br><br>
				The Ratoath Community Board has decided to initially focus on 3 areas of community interest and need : Youth Activities, Village Renewal and Community Marketing. RCB will be organising the Ratoath Community Festival 2014 to be held on Sept 12-14 and during this festival is planning to launch major new initiatives in the area of Youth Activities and Village Renewal.
				<br><br>
				The members of RCB are as follows : Aisling Ahearne, Russell Bailey, Anne Brady, Micheline Clancy, Gerry Dempsey, Francis Lyons, Michael Lysaght, Mary McCormack, Gillian McGrath, Roseina
				Murphy, Aidan O'Byrne, Mary Pocock and Deirdre Smith. Sub-committees will be formed to include a Youth Committee which is intended to enable the youth of Ratoath to organise their own activities.
