		Glee Club - sing dance act
		</p>
		<p>
		Glee Club is now coming to Ratoath community centre!
		</p>
		<p>
		Give your child the opportunity to sing, dance and act like theyve seen it done on shows like glee or fame.
		</p>
		<p>
		Glee Club is for children aged between 4-12. The emphasis on our club is to nourish your childs inner talents for performance, while also helping them develop socially, personally and artistically all in a fun and safe environment. The art of performance can help boost your childs confidence while still having fun and meeting new friends.
		</p>
		<p>
		Some of the reasons children attend glee club
		</p>
		<p>
		To boost self confidence. In my years of running clubs i have witnessed even the shyest of the shy come out of their shells to get up there with the rest of them and perform.
		children have the chance to be creative. a lot of emphasis is placed on the childrens sense of ownership over their work. they are involved in choreography, song choices and writing of the scenes they will perform.
		fun. many of my kids say that coming to glee club is the highlight of their week. think about it.... they get the chance to have fun with and make new friends while singing, dancing and acting their little socks off!
