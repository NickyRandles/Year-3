		"In conversation and in public, Mary Gauthier comes off as a practical, no-nonsense woman. Stoic, even. Which wouldn't seem unusual, except for the fact that her songs carry so much emotional punch, they can leave you staggering.",
		"She has a way of burrowing into that hole so many of us carry inside our souls, and emerging with universal truths that show we aren't so alone after all."
